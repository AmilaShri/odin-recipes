    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tacos al Pastor are a favorite in Mexico and Mexican restaurants throughout 
        the world for good reason: The mixture of smoky, spicy chiles, sweet 
        pineapples and fresh onions and cilantro is taco perfection. Traditionally, 
        Tacos al Pastor are made by marinating pork in chile sauce, layering the meat 
        on a vertical rotisserie, adorning with a pineapple and roasting slowly for 
        hours--a process that's almost impossible to replicate at home.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Bring 2 cups water to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. 
                    Add guajillo and pasilla chiles. Reduce heat to medium-low and 
                    simmer until chiles soften, about 10 minutes; transfer to plate. 
                    Remove and discard stem and seeds. Meanwhile, coarsely chop one onion half; 
                    reserve remaining half. Strain pineapples; reserve juice and fruit separately. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Transfer guajillo, pasilla and chipotle chiles, chopped onion half, reserved pineapple 
                    juice, vinegar, garlic and cumin to bowl of food processor. Puree until smooth, 
                    about 2 minutes. Transfer chile mixture to saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring chile 
                    mixture to a boil; cook until paste loses raw onion taste, about 2 minutes. Season with 
                    Adobo; cool. In large container with lid, or in large ziptop bag, combine pork cubes, 
                    cooled chile marinade and reserved pineapple chunks; transfer to refrigerator. 
                    Marinate at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Strain pork and pineapples, 
                    discarding marinade. Add pork and pineapples to skillet. Cook in batches until 
                    dark golden brown on all sides and cooked through, about 15 minutes; transfer to 
                    large serving plate. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Meanwhile, finely slice remaining onion half. Transfer sliced onion to bowl with cilantro. 
                    Serve pork and pineapple mixture in warm tortillas. Garnish pork tacos with cilantro, 
                    onions and limes. </p>
